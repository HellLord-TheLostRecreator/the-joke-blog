''This film is a fucking piece of shit, the director and producer of this film is Danny Legend who murdered children, don’t forget that one of the actors of the film (Inkster) is a murderer aswell, this film was in production when Inkster had fallen from his quality and joined the dark side by causing edit wars, don’t forget they murdered Greta Thunberg, '''''OUR GOD!!!''''' and they drowned many innocents in there, this is the worst film I have ever seen, I would watch Ren Seeks Help or Aloha Hoëk rather than this piece of shit!''

}}'''<span style="color:red"><span style="font-family:Kameron;">The Fucking Idiots!</span>''' is a film directed and produced by Danny Legend and it was distributed by Starin Pictures, it released in Christmas Day 2020

==Plot==
  
Honestly, the plot is very dark in terms of traumatised children

==Why it is Shit!==
  
<ul><li>The film was not screened for critics, which is always a red flag..... '''Fucking Hell, How Many Times Does This Need to Happen?!?!'''.
  
<ul><li>Even worse, it wasn’t until 2030 that critics were allowed to review the film.
  
<ul><li>It was released in Christmas Day which is also a red flag.
  
<ul><li>It was released as a U rated film despite overused swearing and death, '''Let That Sink In!'''.
  
<ul><li>They chose Danny Legend, of all people, they chose Danny Legend to direct and produce the film, don't forget that this is the same Danny Legend that murdered 50 children and men.
  
<ul><li>This film contains a scene where SKYDL’s character dies from skydiving at night and SKYDL (who voiced his character in this film) was preparing a skydive at night and the crowd was watching it, during the skydive, SKYDL hit the slide that was surrounding the sky and SKYDL was injured, he fell into the water and he wasn’t able to swim due to how injured he was, he drowned at the pool at 20:01 and the place that he died at closed, this shows that this film has a curse on some people that had their characters die in the film.

<ul><li>Two Words: '''Eiji’s Death, Nuff said.'''

<ul><li>To put it in a very dark matter, Eiji was stabbed at his legs, he survived being stabbed but then he was being bitten by the murderers and Eiji screamed out, he was then taken to Brighton where the murderers pushed Eiji into the water and pushed him in and back, after so many pushes, he drowned '''HOLY SHIT!!!!!!'''

<ul><li>Nersh1rt's death was horrible. To make it simple, the murderers stabbed her multiple times and forced her to watch Freddy Got Fingered while putting out lit cigarettes on her arms as she bled out. We can't describe anything else they did as it was too graphic and we don't want a Miraheze steward to come here. After she dies, the murderers do the Caramelldansen.

<ul><li>Worst of all is, Nersh1rt '''actually died shortly after that scene was filmed!!!''' This scene was originally meant to be a torture scene where Nersh1rt survives, and she was originally going to be drowned with the others at the end, but after her death, her character was killed off and written out of the rest of the plot. 

<ul><li>David Failsburg was in this film as Peter God, [https://awfulmovies.miraheze.org/wiki/Blog:David_Failburg_(Fake_Director_(Eiji)) Yep, '''That''' David Failsburg.]

<ul><li>'''Kesner's death, God, Fuck No!''': to put it in an unbiased manner, Kesner (who is now Paprika) found Danny Legend to be the murderer of Nersh1rt and he tried to hit him but then Danny Legend <span style="color:red">'''graphically mutilated him in the style of Mary Jane Kelly!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'''</span>

<ul><li>The ending. '''''DEAR GOD, THE ENDING!!!''''' To put it briefly, HellLord, Stephenfisher2001 and the other remaining users were taken to Hawaii and they were stabbed very graphically, '''THEIR GORE WAS EVEN SHOWN ONSCREEN!!!!!!!''', their hair, arms and legs was later pulled by the murderers and every single one of them were screaming in pain, they were then taken to the beach where the murderers pushed them into the water so that they drown, when they drowned, they danced to Barbie Girl complete with Danny Legend (one of the murderers) flossing, '''THIS IS EVEN WORSE THAN REN DROWNING IN ALOHA HOËK!!!!!!!!!!!!.'''

<ul><li>To make matters worse, '''They actually drowned, WHAT THE FUCK?!!!!!!!!!!'''.

<ul><li>Also, when it was found out that the actors that had their characters murdered was also murdered at the same scenes, people rioted the streets and many people drowned in purpose '''Right, I’m heading outta here, this shit is making people wanna drown themselves'''.

==Redeeming Qualities==

<ul><li>Danny Legend, Inkster and many other murderers drowned in Hawaii after this film was released.

<ul><li>The Living Years (which plays at the scene where Trevor807 dies) is emotional.

<ul><li>Despite some actors/actresses actually dying in the film, some actors/actresses was spared and some of them are still alive as of today (except for SKYDL who drowned in 2021)

<ul><li>Nersh1rt was brought back from the dead a month after this film premiered.

<ul><li>'''"BURN THE WITCH BURN THE WITCH BURN THE MOTHERFUCKING WITCH!!!!!!!!!"'''

==Reception==
I hated this movie! Hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie! Hated it! Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it! Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it! Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it! –Roger Ebert

<ul><li>This film was met with so much negative criticism that all known copies of the film were destroyed in purpose and it remained lost until 2030 when the only surviving copy of the film was uploaded to YouTube.

==Trivia==

[[File:SKYDL.jpeg|thumb|SKYDL’s B&W photo, Taken during his last days]]

<ul><li>This was SKYDL’s final film released in his lifetime as he drowned at Robloxian Waterpark doing his skydive in 2021.

<ul><li>He would appear in 2 more films in 2021 which is The Fucking Douchebags! and The Imagination of Life both of which were released posthumously.

<ul><li>SKYDL hated the film so much that he disowned and destroyed his copy of the film, when asked if he liked the film or not by some interviewers, he said "this film is not supposed to be released, I think it’s a piece of shit, I didn’t even wanna meet the murderers and Danny Legend."

<ul><li>After Nersh1rt was informed in a 2030 interview that the film had one surviving copy left, she said "I thought I had that abomination blocked out from my memory..."

<ul><li>The Fucking Idiots! drowning scenes was actually influenced by Ren drowning in Aloha Hoëk.
